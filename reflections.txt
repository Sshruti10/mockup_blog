Learning web development has been a great experience till now.I have learned a lot of new skills.I have learned alot more about HTML and how to tackle problems ang get through them.Many times certain things get confusing but my mentor and online help is always available to get through it.Till now I found many things easy.I had a little knowledge about HTML so it wasn't very difficult for me.Yes sometimes I got stuck up and had difficulties to understand few syntaxes but my mentor,live help and online help was there. 
My problem solving strategies from first project really helped me out.When I feel stuck up, I take some rest,get refreshed and start again.I interact with community i.e my mentor and live help to discuss the issues I face.I browse internet for learning many things.And keep motivating myself to reach my goals
